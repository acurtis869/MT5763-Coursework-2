## Abstract


## Introduction


## Methods
First the data set was transformed to make it easier to analyse.
```
/* Import dataset */
FILENAME REFFILE '/folders/myshortcuts/SASUniversityEdition/myfolders/MT5763/Coursework 2/Baldy.csv';

PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=REFFILE
	DBMS=CSV
	OUT=MT5763.BALDYRAW;
	GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;

/* Transfrom data to make it easier to analyse */

/* Start by making a new table, with three columns for treatment, hair growth, and age */
/* Create temporary tables for each treatment */
DATA MT5763.LUXURIANT;
SET MT5763.BALDYRAW;
Treatment="Luxuriant";
Growth = Luxuriant;
Age = AgeLuxuriant;
KEEP Treatment Growth Age
RUN;

DATA MT5763.PLACEBO;
SET MT5763.BALDYRAW;
Treatment="Placebo";
Growth = Placebo;
Age = AgePlacebo;
KEEP Treatment Growth Age
RUN;

DATA MT5763.BALDBEGONE;
SET MT5763.BALDYRAW;
Treatment="BaldBeGone";
Growth = BaldBeGone;
Age = AgeBaldBeGone;
KEEP Treatment Growth Age
RUN;

DATA MT5763.SKINHEADNOMORE;
SET MT5763.BALDYRAW;
Treatment="Skinheadnomore";
Growth = Skinheadnomore;
Age = AgeSkinheadnomore;
KEEP Treatment Growth Age
RUN;

/* Now merge these temporary tables to create new table */
DATA MT5763.Baldy;
SET MT5763.LUXURIANT MT5763.PLACEBO MT5763.BALDBEGONE MT5763.SKINHEADNOMORE; 
RUN;

/* Transform growth from inches into mm */
DATA MT5763.Baldy;
SET MT5763.Baldy;
Growth = Growth * 25.4;
RUN;
```
